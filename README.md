# Outfit Make - React Photobooth & Avatar Generator

A simple boilerplate React application using Cloudinary and Outfit Make to allow you to create your own virtual photobooths.

## Getting Started

The photobooth was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so all of the standard things apply.

### Installation

Super simple, install the dependencies in the project directory.

```
cd react-photobooth
```

```
yarn install
```

### Running the application

```
yarn-start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deployment

```
yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Built With

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - Simple react app framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - Styled with love using CSS-in-JS
- [Outfit Make](https://make.cm/) - Image generation API
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) - Client-side image uploading API (see [here](#cloudinary-unsigned-uploading) for more)
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Handling API requests

## Outfit Make Image Generation

To generate the images we're using Outfit Make. Make allows you create API endpoints out of React templates by importing them into Make.

For documentation on customising your Make request check out the docs [here](https://docs.make.cm/api-reference/make-asset)

### Creating a template

1. Fork this existing Make/React template

2. Customise your template

3. Once finished `yarn build` the application

4. Push the template changes back to Github (including the build directory)

5. In Make, click Import template and follow the steps to import your recently updated template from Github

Now you've got a template endpoint that we can send Make requests to ðŸš€ðŸš€

### Setting up your request

1. In your imported template's API playground click on the API keys dropdown and select or create an API key

2. From the API playground copy out the request URL (`apiUrl`) and the `X-MAKE-API-KEY`

3. In the `react-photobooth` application go to the `appState.js` file and paste in the request URL and the API key into the corresponding `consts`.

## Cloudinary Unsigned Uploading

The photobooth is currently using Cloudinary's [face-detection transformations](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/javascript_image_and_video_upload) to detect and centre faces to the artwork.

For this, we have used the unsigned [Upload API](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images#unsigned_upload) to push images to Cloudinary. To get started do the following:

1. Create an account
2. Create an unsigned upload preset from `Account Settings > Upload`
   - Signing Method: `unsigned`
   - Delivery Type: `Upload`
   - Access Mode: `Public`
3. Copy the Upload Preset & Cloud Name
4. Paste those into the `cloudinaryUploadPreset` and `cloudinaryCloudName`in the [providers > appState.js](/src/providers/appState.js) file
